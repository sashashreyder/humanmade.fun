        Templates are definitely great for saving time and money for small and beginner businesses. 
        But let's not forget about the artists, developers, and designers who work with their hands, minds, and vision.
        I also want to express my appreciation to Canva! Your work is inspiring, thoughtful, and will help us work faster and more efficiently. 
        A great helper!
